                    <p>I am a purposeful and highly motivated person who can adapt quickly to new team. My qualities such as stress resistance, hardworking and detail orientation make me good at teamwork. My punctuality is the key to successful delivery of projects on time. </p>
                    <p>I am looking for company which I can improve my knowledge and experience, realize my potential. I would like to contribute to the company growth. </p>
                    <p>I want to change the sphere of activity due to lack of personal development (I consider the profession of an assistant to be a deadlock) in order to apply the technologies I know in real projects and learn new ones and enjoy it. From my personal qualities I would like to single out: purposefulness, stress resistance, easy learning, understanding that “need to work.” He served in the army.</p>
